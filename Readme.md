# Solid Principles
## Single Responsibility Principle 
- A class should have one reason to change (one job of responsiblity)
  
## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- open to extenstion , closed for modification which means that you should be able to add new behavior , and shouldn't modify existing code 

## Liskov Substitution Prinicple (LSP)
- subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program which means if you have base class , you should be able to replace it with any of its derived classes without breaking the behavior of the program.
